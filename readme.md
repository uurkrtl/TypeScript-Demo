## Coding: TypeScript Basics

Create a new Vite project with the vanilla and TypeScript template in IntelliJ.

* Step 1: Declare a variable named 'age' of type 'number' and assign a value to it.
* Step 2: Write a 'for' loop that outputs the numbers from 1 to 'age'.
* Step 3: Use an 'if-else' statement to check if 'age' is greater than 18.
  Display appropriate messages depending on whether the condition is met or not.
* Step 4: Declare a variable named 'score' of type 'number' and assign it the value 0.
* Step 5: Use an 'if' statement to check if 'score' has a value.
  Display 'Score is available.' if 'score' has a value other than 0.
* Step 6: Use an 'if-else' statement to check if 'score' is evaluated as a 'truthy' value.
  Display 'Score is evaluated as truthy.' if 'score' is considered 'truthy'.
* Step 7: Declare a variable named 'username' of type 'string' and assign it the value '' (empty string).
* Step 8: Use an 'if' statement to check if 'username' has a value.
  Display 'Username is available.' if 'username' has a value.
* Step 9: Use an 'if-else' statement to check if 'username' is evaluated as a 'falsy' value.
  Display 'Username is evaluated as falsy.' if 'username' is considered 'falsy'.
* Step 10: Declare a variable named 'isAdmin' of type 'boolean' and assign it the value 'false'.
* Step 11: Use an 'if-else' statement to check if 'isAdmin' is evaluated as a 'truthy' value.
  Display 'isAdmin is evaluated as truthy.' if 'isAdmin' is considered 'truthy'.
* Step 12: Use an 'if' statement to check if 'isAdmin' is 'false'.
  Display 'isAdmin is false.' if 'isAdmin' has the value 'false'.
